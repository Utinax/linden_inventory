##### If you require the items list in another resource, rather than querying the database
```lua
--MySQL.ready(function()
--	local items = MySQL.Sync.fetchAll('SELECT * FROM items')

MySQL.ready(function()
	local items = exports.linden_inventory:Items()
```

## What's changed?
##### This information concerns the initial release of linden_inventory
Despite all the changes I've implemented to hsn-inventory, there's a lot that I hadn't changed since I didn't want to break things I wasn't familiar with. There was a lot of functions or events performing the same (or very similar) tasks, sometimes only being used once if at all; my biggest issue though was with the inventory data saving. I've moved the project so that a still incomplete but mostly working version of hsn-inventory can remain as it is, but without any future support by myself.

* Cleaned up or optimised many functions and events
* Changed data formatting when sending information between client and server (a lot of data was sent twice or fragmented)
* Moved config around to make things a little more accessable, moved some tables into config where appropriate
* Global inventory tables for shops to load from, instead of entering the data for each
* Support for randomising prices at each shop at resource startup (disabled)
* Removed defined variables that weren't being called
* Inventories are now stored in a single table to make referencing data a lot less of a hassle
* Inventory data saving is more agnostic (don't need separate statements for each inventory type)
* Cleaner transition from regular inventory to a drop and vice versa
* Drops should be created and removed properly, and existing drops are loaded to client at login
* Improved performance
* Support for setting a players max weight
* New exports for use with xPlayer functions, to remove the need for modifying the framework in the future
* Full syncing of accounts data with inventory
* Better error catching and a method of preventing the resource from setting/saving data when it isn't loaded correctly
* Mark when an inventory is changed and only query the database if items have moved
* Better tracking of an inventory's state (if it's open)
* And more... (it's hard to remember every change made over 48 hours)
